After aggressively slapping piano keys since I was 3, because apparently toddler me thought I was Beethoven reincarnated, it only took a casual 15 years to realize that maybe I should actually do something with this music thing. So somewhere around the sweet spot of 18–19, I entered the world of music production. A place where you oscillate hourly between “yo this slaps” and “what in the GarageBand hell is this?”

For the record, GarageBand is absolutely fire.

Welcome to the chaos. Here’s what I’ve learned while pretending to be a music producer in 2025.

### Mixing an Acoustic Guitar  
##### a.k.a. “I swear this sounded better at 2AM”

When I first started mixing acoustic guitar, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. This did not stop me from confidently stacking plugins like I was building a Jenga tower out of presets. Warm, wide, crisp, nostalgic, cinematic, bedroom-produced. I wanted all of it. At the same time.

What I got was a muddy reverb soup.

After enough trial and error, deleting entire sessions, and rewatching the same YouTube tutorials with rising caffeine levels and diminishing sanity, I landed on a chain that finally gave me the clean-but-dreamy tone I wanted for my semi-acoustic.

Here’s what actually stuck.

**EQ**  
I roll off everything below 80Hz. No one needs sub-bass from an acoustic unless you’re summoning whales. I scoop gently around 300–500Hz to clear out the boxiness, then add a soft lift in the 2k–5k range for clarity and air without harshness.

**Compression**  
Nothing heroic. 3:1 ratio, 10ms attack, 100ms release, around 4dB of gain reduction. Just enough to tame the dynamics without killing the performance.

**IR Loader**  
This was a surprise win. I use a church impulse response. Not for religious reasons, but because it adds a depth that makes a bedroom recording feel like it exists in a real space instead of a sad corner of my room.

**Reeverb 2**  
Drum Studio preset. Yes, for guitar. Short room, tight decay, barely noticeable until you mute it and everything collapses. This is the glue.

**Limiter**  
Final safety net. Ceiling at -0.1dB, just catching rogue transients without flattening the track.

This chain will not save a bad recording. Nothing will. But it consistently turns a decent take into something that feels intentional, which in production is half the battle.


### Programming Drums  
##### learning restraint the hard way

Early on, I treated drums like they were meant to impress other producers instead of serve the song. Too many fills, too many layers, ghost notes everywhere, velocity randomness dialed up like a chaos slider.

It took me way too long to realize that good drums don’t announce themselves. They *support*. The kick doesn’t need to be clever. The snare doesn’t need personality. They just need to land, consistently, and make everything else feel expensive.

Once I started thinking of drums as architecture rather than decoration, things clicked. Fewer elements. Clear transients. Space between hits. Letting silence do some of the work.

Which brings me to the biggest lesson of all.


### Sound is only half the music

“Music is an amalgamation of sound and space.”  
Courtesy of Pranav Swaroop, and permanently etched into my brain.

This single idea changed how I arrange, mix, and even write. Notes matter, but the gaps between them matter just as much. Reverb isn’t about size, it’s about placement. Compression isn’t about loudness, it’s about control. Arrangement isn’t about adding, it’s about knowing when to stop.

Once I stopped filling every hole with noise, my tracks started breathing. And breathing tracks feel human.


### Motivation is fragile, ride it when it shows up

I had a sudden burst of motivation after watching Steven Wilson live. No productivity hack, no YouTube video, no plugin demo has ever come close to that feeling. Just watching someone who has complete control over sound, dynamics, and space reminded me why I started.

I came back wanting to *listen* better. To respect silence. To stop overproducing out of insecurity.

### Tools matter, but timing matters more

I bought Studio One 7 Pro on an impulse. No spreadsheet. No “best DAW” research spiral. Just a gut decision.

Still one of the best purchases I’ve made.

Not because it magically made my music better, but because it removed friction. When the tool gets out of your way, ideas survive longer. Momentum stays alive. And momentum is everything.


### Closing thoughts

2025 taught me that producing isn’t about flexing knowledge. It’s about taste. About restraint. About learning when to step back and let the track exist on its own terms.

I still oscillate between “this slaps” and “what is this,” but the gap between those two moments is shrinking.

And honestly, that’s progress enough.
